This game is controlled using a mouse to select menu options and the character is controlled using the A and D keys to move left and right and the Space key to attack. The goal of the game is to control Angus McFife XIII, The Sire of Dundee to defeat the evil wizard Zargothrax and his army of Chaos Wizards. This game has a high-score system to keep track of the highest 3 scores. The game is won when all the chaos wizards are dead. Angus McFife will die if he is hit by the Chaos Wizards lightning and the game will produce a game over.
